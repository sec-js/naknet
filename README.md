# NAKNET
A proof of concept Centralized Botnet based on the botnet given by ![Aoyama](https://github.com/Leeon123/Aoyama) by ![Leeon123](https://github.com/Leeon123).

Currently expanded functionality:
	DOOM tab opener	: Increases volume on clients and opens a url based on two settings: annoy and kill
	CMD exec		: Remote command execution that sends output from client to CNC and to the commander
	ARP Snoop		: Reads the ARP Table and returns the IP to the Commander should Port 22 be open.
	Brute Force SSH	: Attempts to brute force logins on a victim and returns results to Commander
